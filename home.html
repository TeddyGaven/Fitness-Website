    <p class="para">Being healthy means not only away from diseases but it also means the complete feeling of physical, mental and social well being. Maintaining health and fitness is not a simple task however; not so tough too. We need to involve ourselves into some daily physical activities together with the healthy, fresh and timely food which can only provide us long-term health and fitness benefits. We burn extra and unnecessary calories to our body through physical exercises. Daily physical exercises keep kids so active and put them on a path of better physical and mental health.

        Physical activities along with the proper nutrition are really very beneficial to the people of all ages from any background and abilities. Being involved in the daily physical exercises is a good strategy to defeat obesity. According to the statistics, it is found that around one-third of the U.S. adult citizens are obese and almost 17% of children and adolescents are obese. There are many people suffering from the diabetes and other chronic health problems such as heart disease, high blood pressure, cancer, asthma, overweight, etc.
        
        We can be fit just by incorporating some physical activities including healthy eating to our daily life for 30 minutes (for adults) and 60 minutes (for children). Regular physical activities help us to get long-term health benefits through:
        
        Prevention from chronic diseases (heart disease, cancer, and stroke);
        Weight control;
        Reducing extra fat;
        Making muscles healthy and stronger;
        Promoting strong bone and joint development;
        Enhancing overall strength and endurance;
        Improving sleep and keeping away from sleep disorders;
        Relieves stress;
        Increases chance of living longer;
        Increases energy level and self-esteem;
        Reduces potential of being depressed; 
        Promoting health of heart and lungs;  
        People, who are not physically active, become highly prone to the risks like cancer, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, high blood cholesterol, stroke, heart disease, etc.</p>

    <div class="para1">
    <p class="para">In addition to regular exercise, a healthy, well balanced diet is essential for good health.  A well balanced diet would contain the three main groups of food as well as important vitamins and minerals.

        The first group of carbohydrates is found in foods such as bread, potatoes and rice. They are essentially energy giving foods which power the muscles and other tissues in our body. The next class of food is the proteins which form the solid part in all living cells. They are commonly found in meat and fish and are necessary for the body to build new cells and repair the old damaged ones. Lastly, we have fats, which are also energy- living foods , but do not give it up as quickly as carbohydrates because their molecular structure is designed to render them ideal as storage foods.
        
        As children are much more active than adults, they use up more energy for their size and therefore require more energy giving foods such as carbohydrates. Too much of a fatty food intake at an early age may lead to a problem with obesity in later life.
        
        The body also needs small quantities of protective substances called vitamins and minerals. For example vitamins A and D are found in some fatty foods. Vitamin D is important along with the mineral calcium , found in milk, for the formation of bones. Vitamin B is found in the husks of wheat or rice and vitamin C in fresh fruits such as oranges and lemons.</p>
